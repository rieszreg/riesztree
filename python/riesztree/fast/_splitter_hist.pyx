"""Cython histogram-based best-split sweep.

Per-leaf algorithm:
  1. Accumulate a histogram of (sum_D, sum_C, count_orig) per bin
     for each feature, over the rows in the leaf. O(n_leaf · p).
  2. For each feature, sweep ``n_bins - 1`` candidate split positions,
     computing left/right (D, C, orig_count) via running cumulatives
     and evaluating the gain via the loss-aware leaf-loss kernel.
     O(p · max_bins).
  3. Track the best split across features.

This eliminates the per-leaf ``np.argsort`` that dominates the
exact splitter's cost for large ``n_leaf``. Bin width is set by the
:class:`riesztree.fast._binner.BinMapper` at fit start (default 255
quantile bins per feature).

Approximation: the best split lies on a bin boundary, not on a
distinct value. With 255 bins on quantile-sampled data the gap to the
exact split is typically negligible for split-ranking; the leaf α*
itself is unaffected by binning (it depends only on (D_leaf, C_leaf),
both summed exactly within the leaf).
