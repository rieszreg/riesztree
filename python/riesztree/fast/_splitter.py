"""Python-side facade for the Cython splitter.

Translates a ``LossSpec`` instance to the integer ``loss_kind`` used by
the compiled kernels, plus the ``(lo, hi)`` parameters needed by
``BoundedSquaredLoss``. Custom user losses (anything not in the four
built-ins) can plug in via :func:`register_fast_leaf_solver`, which
registers a Numba ``@cfunc`` (or any C-callable with the matching
signature) for that loss subclass; the dispatcher in
:mod:`riesztree.grow` then routes continuous splits through the
user's compiled kernel at C speed. If no kernel is registered the
dispatcher falls back to the pure-Python splitter with a one-time
``UserWarning``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss_class
        The user's LossSpec subclass. The splitter uses MRO to
        match — registering the most specific class wins.
    leaf_loss_addr_or_cfunc
        Either an integer (a raw C-callable address) or an object
        with a ``.address`` attribute (e.g. a Numba ``@cfunc``).
        Signature ``double(double, double)``; called from the Cython
        splitter without the GIL.
    alpha_at_opt
        Python callable ``(D, C) -> alpha_star``. Used by
        ``_make_leaf`` to populate the leaf payload and by pruning to
        compute the would-be-leaf α at internal nodes. A
        Numba ``@cfunc`` instance also works (it's a Python callable
        too); plain ``def`` is fine if perf isn't critical here.
