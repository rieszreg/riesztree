"""riesztree: single-tree backend for the rieszreg meta-package.

A single decision tree fit by greedy splits on the augmented Bregman-Riesz
loss. Each leaf stores the closed-form per-leaf optimum
``α_ℓ* = -C_ℓ / D_ℓ`` (loss-aware: projected to the loss's α-domain), so
the same tree structure works for ``SquaredLoss``, ``KLLoss``,
``BernoulliLoss``, and ``BoundedSquaredLoss``.

Importing this module registers the predictor loader for
``rieszreg.RieszEstimator.load`` to round-trip ``"riesztree"`` predictors.
